However, the operators have chosen to proactively align with U.S. regulations detailed
under 18 U.S.C. §2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75. This ensures adherence to U.S. standards,
clarifying that all visuals on this site are exempt from 18 U.S.C. §2257 and 28 C.R.F. 75
due to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The content doesn’t depict sexually explicit acts as outlined in 18 U.S.C. §2257
(2)(A)(i)-(iv).</li>
<li>No representations of the genital or pubic region were made post-July 27, 2006.</li>
<li>Simulated sexual activities presented were established before Title 18 U.S.C.</li>
<li>§2257 came into effect.</li>
<li>All content was crafted before July 3, 1995.</li>
</ul>
<p>All individuals showcased on this website were at least 21 at the time of content
creation.</p>
<h6>Third-Party Content</h6>
<p>This website's operators are not responsible for producing any actual or simulated
sexually explicit content. When such content is found, the operator's role is solely that of
transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, and presentation. These depictions are posted
by third-party users and are managed in user-controlled areas of the site. Under Title 18
U.S.C. §2257 (h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. §230 (c), the operators retain the right to remove
content deemed inappropriate or inconsistent with the site's policies and terms.
