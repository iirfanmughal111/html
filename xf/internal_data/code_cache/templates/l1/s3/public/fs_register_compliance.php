However, the operators have chosen to proactively align with U.S. regulations detailed

(2)(A)(i)-(iv).</li>
<li>No representations of the genital or pubic region were made post-July 27, 2006.</li>
<li>Simulated sexual activities presented were established before Title 18 U.S.C.</li>
<li>§2257 came into effect.</li>
<li>All content was crafted before July 3, 1995.</li>

U.S.C. §2257 (h)(2)(B)(v) and 47 U.S.C. §230 (c), the operators retain the right to remove
content deemed inappropriate or inconsistent with the site\'s policies and terms.
