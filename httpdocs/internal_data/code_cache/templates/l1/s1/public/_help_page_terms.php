protect both our advertisers and SWB. Before moving forward, please take the time to
carefully read and understand all the provisions outlined. Submitting your details
signifies that you\'ve comprehended and agreed to all the Terms and Conditions
enclosed. We advise retaining a copy of this Agreement for your personal records.
Should you face any issues accessing the Agreement, please contact us *prior* to
continuing your registration.</p>

<p>**NOTE**: The content within is not just a reference; it acts as the binding Advertiser
Agreement between you and SWB. Upon accepting its stipulations, you affirm:</p>

<p>- The platform is strictly for adults. Any indication of underage involvement will lead to
immediate reporting to appropriate legal channels.</p>

<p>- You have reached legal adulthood, 21 based on your jurisdiction\'s age of majority, and
are in a position to enter into a binding agreement.</p>

<p>- Depending on your location or the specific US state, the age criteria for advertising on
SWB is 21. You confirm your adherence to this.</p>

<p>- Your account on SWB is individual, as we only onboard independent advertisers. We do
not accept agency-linked accounts.</p>

<p>- Recognizing SWB as merely an advertising medium, you understand that SWB remains
free from any liabilities stemming from your activities on the platform.</p>

<p>- You\'ve read the entirety of this Advertiser Agreement and consent to all its conditions.</p>

<p>- All content you contribute is either your intellectual property, or you have the necessary
permissions to utilize it. You exempt SWB and associated entities from any potential
claims resulting from this content\'s usage or display.</p>

<p>- You commit to respecting all pertinent federal, state, and local regulations, pledging to
avoid illicit activities on the website.</p>

<p>- Your interaction with SWB must be purely for personal entertainment purposes. We
strictly prohibit alternate intentions and don\'t support illegal endeavors. As an SWB user,
you are bound by your jurisdiction\'s laws.</p>

<p>- Any usage of SWB that defies the regulations of your jurisdiction is forbidden. You
agree to shield SWB from any legal repercussions arising from your legal breaches or in
instances where third-party actions harm you or your actions adversely affect others.</p>

<p>- This Agreement follows the laws of the Netherlands. Any disputes stemming from this
Agreement shall be negotiated in good faith. You agree to the jurisdiction of the
Netherlands for dispute resolution, recognizing it as the exclusive venue.</p>

<p>Our membership does not auto-renew, eliminating the need for manual cancellations.
Once your membership duration concludes, we\'ll send an email reminder, offering a
renewal option. Should you decide against it, you needn\'t take any action—your
membership will naturally expire, and there will be no subsequent credit card charges.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reject, suspend, or terminate any membership or application, at
any time and for any reason.</p>

<p>Should a membership or application be rejected, paused, ended, or cancelled by the
member, we do not provide refunds, even if the membership period remains.</p>

<p>For age verification and security, companions are required to submit identification
photos throughout their membership. These images are retained as long as the account
is active.</p>

<p>Upon a "hard delete" request, we will erase accounts permanently.</p>

<p>Governed by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 7001, et seq. (“E-Sign Act”), this Agreement upholds the authority of electronic
signatures. When you click “I Agree” or a similar affirmation and forward this document,
you assert your understanding and agreement to its terms. If you prefer a traditional
signing method, reach out to SWB.</p>

<p>To use SWB, consent to this Agreement\'s Terms is mandatory. Engaging with our
website means you fully acknowledge and accept these conditions.</p>';
